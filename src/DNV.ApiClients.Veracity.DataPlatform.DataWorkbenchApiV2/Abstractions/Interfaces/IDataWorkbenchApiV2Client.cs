    /// # What is Data Workbench?
    /// Data Workbench allows you to:
    /// * Get access to external data from different sources, f.ex. emission
    /// data, that can be used in your applications.
    /// * Securely share your data and use data shared by others.
    /// * Monitor who uses your data, limit how long it is available, and
    /// revoke access to it.
    /// * Build dashboards and reports on top of the data.
    /// * Work with scalable data streams and self-defined non-time-series data
    /// streams.
    ///
    /// For details, see [Data Workbench on
    /// Marketplace](https://store.veracity.com/b692-2dd3fb6b0225-workbench).
    ///
    /// ## Tenants and workspaces
    /// Each company or a B2C customer has one tenant in Data Workbench. A
    /// tenant can have multiple workspaces. Each workspace has members.
    /// Workspace members can be admins or readers.
    ///
    /// ## Data sets
    /// To see data sets available in your workspace, go to the **Data
    /// Catalogue** tab.
    ///
    /// The **Predefined data sets** tab shows data sets that are queried by
    /// connections from their corresponding source systems. These data sets
    /// are inherited, and you cannot modify them. However, you can use them to
    /// create new data sets.
    ///
    /// The **Created data sets** tab shows the data sets that workspace
    /// members created.
    ///
    /// Each data set has:
    /// * Title and description.
    /// * Column picker – show or hide table columns.
    /// * Filters - filter data.
    /// * Save option – save your changes.
    /// * Share option – share a data set with a user, and set for how long you
    /// grant them access.
    ///
    /// To see data sets you can use, go to [My
    /// data](https://data.veracity.com/containers).
    /// To see how to manage your data on Data Fabric, go
    /// [here](https://help-center.veracity.com/en/collections/2429587-managing-your-data-on-data-fabric).
